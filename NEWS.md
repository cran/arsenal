# arsenal v1.5.0

* `tableby()` and `paired()`:

    - fixed a bug with specifying individual statistics for character and logical vectors. (#142)

    - `tableby()` and `paired()`: added a function (`notest()`) to prevent performing a test on an individual variable. (#144)

    - `summary.tableby()`: changed NA p-values to blanks. (#145)

    - `summary.tableby()`: added documentation on `bookdown`. (#147)
    
    - Wrote `padjust()`, an S3 wrapper for `p.adjust()`, which can also adjust `tableby()` (and hence `paired()`) objects. (#146)
    
    - `print.summary.tableby()`, `as.data.frame.summary.tableby()`: added `width=` and `min.split=` as formal arguments.
    
    - Fixed `medSurv()` which was calculating the median survival incorrectly, and removed `rangeTime()`, an ambiguous survival statistic. (#32)

* `modelsum()`:

    - `summary.modelsum()`: added documentation on `bookdown`. (#147)
    
    - `print.summary.modelsum()`, `as.data.frame.summary.modelsum()`: added `width=` and `min.split=` as formal arguments.
    
* `summary.freqlist()`: added documentation on `bookdown`. (#147)

* `formulize()`: added support for names and calls. (#152, #153)

# arsenal v1.4.0

**There are a few non-backwards-compatible updates.**

Major changes:

* `modelsum()`:

    - Added `family="ordinal"` to do ordinal logistic regression using `MASS::polr()`. (#130)

    - Added `family="negbin"` to do negative binomial regression using `MASS::glm.nb()`. (#15)
  
    - Added support for ordinal regressors and adjustment terms (by adding support for their associated contrasts). (#133)
    
    - Allowed for LaTeX formatting. NOTE: this changes (hence possibly breaking old code) the formatting behavior when specifying `text="html"`. (#123)

* `summary.compare.data.frame()`: Added a small summary of the input data.frames as the first table. (#126)
  NOTE: this changes the structure and printed output of `summary()`!
  
* `tableby()`:

    - Allowed for LaTeX formatting. NOTE: this changes (hence possibly breaking old code) the formatting behavior when specifying `text="html"`. (#123)

    - Added functionality to in-formula functions to allow the specification of `digits=` (etc.), `numeric.simplify=`, and `cat.simplify=`
      for a single variable. (#107, #134, #139)  NB: this has the following breaking changes:
    
        * There is no longer a "name" element in the "tableby" object's x-specifications; instead it's now called "term"
    
        * An element for "variable", containing the variable name, was added to the "tableby" object's x-specifications.
    
        * An element for "control.list", recording format specifications, was added to the "tableby" object's x-specifications.
    
        * The output of `as.data.frame.tableby()` now reports only the variable name in the "variable" column when using
          internal statistical functions (like `anova()` and `chisq()`--it used to include the function call as well).
      
        * The output of `as.data.frame.tableby()` no longer includes category levels in the "term" column;
          instead, it contains the statistical function used (like `countpct()` and `count()`).
      
Smaller changes:

* `modelsum()`:

    - Added support for *calls* to the family functions, in case a different link function (for example) is required.
    
    - Properly propogated "term.name" to the `as.data.frame()` method. (#128)
    
    - Fixed formatting of error about unsupported families.
    
    - Removed "concordance" from the list of supported statistics for Poisson regression. This shouldn't break much code, as specifying "concordance"
      wouldn't have shown anything anyway.
      
    - Fixed a bug with formatting one-per-model p-values. (#140)
    
* `tableby()`:

    - Added a warning for when by-variable contains empty string. (#121)
    
    - Properly propogated "term.name" to the `as.data.frame()` method. (#127)
    
    - Fixed an error that sometimes occured when using categorical statistics on numeric variables. (#137)
    
    - Added an argument to `tableby.control()` to simplify one-line numeric output. (#139)
    
* `paired()`:

    - Added a warning for when by-variable contains empty string. (#121)
    
    - Added error to `na.paired("in.both")` when there are more than two time points.

* `compare.data.frame()`:

    - Implemented `n.diff.obs()`. (#124)
    
    - Added an argument to `summary()` to allow for the display of attributes. (#125)

    - Fixed `summary()` to now return the object passed it. (#141)
      
* Updated documentation where appropriate.

Major changes:

* Implemented the function `paired()` for paired data, based on `tableby()`. This comes with a very light vignette.

    - The first argument to `freqlist()` has changed from `tab=` to `object=`, for S3 consistency. (#35)

    - `freqlist.formula()` was implemented, piggybacking off of `stats::xtabs()`. (#35)
    
    - The `title=` argument was added to `summary.freqlist()`. Passing `caption=` through the dots to `knitr::kable()`
      will now throw an error. (#34)
      
* `tableby()`:

    - `as.data.frame.tableby()` has been totally overhauled. It now uses list-columns to give exact values.
    
    - `summary.tableby()` has been totally overhauled.

        * Most arguments are no longer named, but passed through the dots.
    
        * It now returns an object, abusing in the process `as.data.frame.tableby()`.
          `print.summary.tableby()` prints the resulting object. (#8)
        
        * `print.summary.tableby()` now uses `knitr::kable()` to print results, instead of internal functions.
          As such, non-exported helper functions have all been removed.

    - The arguments to `tableby.control()` have changed. Warnings will be issued for using old arguments.
    
        * `nsmall=` has been removed. `digits=` takes its place.
        
        * `nsmall.pct=` and `digits.test=` have been renamed to `digits.pct=` and `digits.p=`, respectively.
        
        * There's now an option for count digits (`digits.count=`).
        
        * `format.p=` has been added, to turn on formatting of p-values.
        
        * `q1q3` is no longer a default continuous statistic.
        
    - NAs can be included in percents using `includeNA()`. (#57)
    
    - Some additional survival summary functions are now available. (#32)
    
    - It is now possible to report row-percents using `countrowpct()`. (#9)

* `modelsum()`:

    - `modelsum()` has been totally overhauled:
    
        * It now uses `stats::model.frame()` and unevaluated calls instead of custom-creating
          data.frames.
          
        * It now allows for non-syntactic names (#44, #45).

    - `as.data.frame.modelsum()` has been totally overhauled. It now gives exact
      values instead of formatted values.

    - `summary.modelsum()` has been totally overhauled.

        * Most arguments are no longer named, but passed through the dots.
    
        * It now returns an object, abusing in the process `as.data.frame.modelsum()`.
          `print.summary.modelsum()` prints the resulting object. (#37)
        
        * `print.summary.modelsum()` now uses `knitr::kable()` to print results, instead of internal functions.
          As such, non-exported helper functions have all been removed.
          
        * `print.summary.modelsum()` now strips leading and trailing whitespace from labels to fix formatting with `text=FALSE`. (#48)
    
        * `labelTranslations=` no longer accepts labels for the statistics columns.
          Use `modelsum.control(stat.labels=)` for this instead.

    - The arguments to `modelsum.control()` have changed. Warnings will be issued for using old arguments.
    
        * `nsmall=` has been removed. `digits=` takes its place.
        
        * `nsmall.ratio=` and `digits.test=` have been renamed to `digits.ratio=` and `digits.p=`, respectively.
        
        * `format.p=` has been added, to turn off formatting of p-values.
        
        * `stat.labels=` has been added, to label the statistics columns.
    
    - `"[.modelsum"()` now has a named argument, and accepts character, numeric, and logical subscripts.

Smaller changes:

* `freqlist()`:

    - `freqlist()` will no longer issue a warning about using the deprecated `varnames=` argument.

    - `print.freqlist()` has been made slightly more concise. The only change to the printed output
      is making "variables" singular ("variable") when only one variable is present.
    
* `tableby()`:

    - `tableby()` has also been made slightly more concise and easier to read.

    - A bug was fixed when trying to specify "stats" attributes for categorical variables. (#39)

    - `labels<-.tableby()` now accepts `NULL` to set all labels to NULL. (#52)

    - The function `Nmiss2()` is now exported for `tableby()`. Note that it is exactly the same as `Nmiss()`, but
      is interpreted differently in `tableby()`.
      
* `modelsum()`:

    - `modelsum()` has been made slightly more concise.
    
    - "Nmiss2" has been added to the `modelsum()` object and no longer replaces "Nmiss".
    
    - `as.data.frame.modelsum()` no longer turns "<0.001" into `NA`. (#31)
    
    - `as.data.frame.modelsum()` no longer breaks if there are too many adjustment variables. (#12)
    
    - `summary.modelsum()` now has working labels for factors. (#13)
